            <h5>Message From the Chairman</h5>
            <p>
                In 2022, the COVID-19 pandemic started to improve, resulting in the domestic economy beginning to recover. Meanwhile, the global economy has slowed down due to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, causing an economic downturn for Russia by the Western Hemisphere. Additionally, China continues to implement its Zero COVID policy, and all of these factors have led to a slowdown in production and transportation. Thailand has also been affected by this slowdown, so it is considered another challenge for the Company to plan business operations and evaluate the situation closely, in order to prepare to promptly adapt to the fluctuating circumstances in order to achieve the business objectives as planned. The Company’s Board of Directors, executives, and staff in all departments have fulfilled their duties to the best of their abilities.

                In 2022, the Company had a total revenue of 1,938.9 million baht, a slight increase compared to the previous year. This was due to the slowdown of the economy caused by the aforementioned factors. Additionally, the freight charges decreased due to the easing of the container shortage problem, and the demand for product transportation decreased. Nevertheless, revenue from the sales of dialysis solutions continued to increase by 14.2 million baht compared to 2021, as a result of the price adjustment of the dialysis solutions in terms of cost and expenses, which increased by 8 percent compared to the previous year. The main reason for this was the increase in expenses related to professional consulting services for the purpose of business expansion.

                Furthermore, the Company continues to adhere to the policy of expanding its business in line with the Company’s vision and mission to be a leader in providing full-service logistics and has expanded its business in the Non-Logistics sector to reduce the risk of relying solely on logistics business. Additionally, there has been a restructuring of internal management to accommodate the Company’s business expansion.
