                NCL International Logistics Public Company Limited (“Company” or “NCL”) is a logistics provider. Established by Mr. Kitti Phuathavornskul, NCL International Logistics PCL Group was aimed to engage in international freight forwarding services.

(VP); and Unitrans Global Co., Limited (UNI).

                The Company started international freight forwarding services in 1994, which were operated under VP International Logistics (Thailand) Co., Ltd. (VP). It started LCL freight forwarding for the route: Thailand - the Americas and expanded routes to Asia and Europe in 1996 and 2000, respectively.

                To restructure the management within the Group and eliminate potential conflicts of interest, VP ceased its operation in 2009 and in 2011, staff who founded UNI sold UNI shares to Mr. Phuathavornskul, the Company’s major shareholder. Later, Mr. Phuathavornskul sold all UNI shares to external parties; however, UNI still utilized the Company’s buildings for its business operations and relied on the Company in terms of documentation and accounting and financial management. Presently, VP and UNI have ceased their business; they notified the Department of Revenue of their business termination in July 2012, and they are now awaiting liquidation. Accordingly, the only operating company is NCL International Logistics Co., Ltd. (“the Company” or “NCL”).

                Since its inception, the Company has grown steadily and has been able to provide both LCL and FCL services and has acted as a customs broker and goods issuance agent. Growing continuously in the international freight forwarding business, in 2011, the Company invested in domestic freight forwarding services by purchasing tractor heads and trailer trucks to ensure service continuity.  The first route established was the southern route and expanded to the East and Bangkok.
