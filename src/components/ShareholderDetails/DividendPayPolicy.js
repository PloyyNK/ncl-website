                <p>
                    The Company’s dividend payment policy is to pay at least 50 percent of its net profit after the deduction of all reserves. Dividend payments must not adversely affect the Company’s operations, financial position, liquidity, business expansion, necessity, future suitability, or other factors relevant to the Company’s administration, as determined by the Board of Directors deems, and must yield maximum benefits to the shareholders.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The subsidiaries will consider paying dividends based on the net profit after the deduction of the corporate income tax each year. However, this will depend on the investment plan and other suitability considerations. The subsidiaries may pay interim dividends to their shareholders from time to time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Board of Directors’ resolution regarding dividend payments must be proposed at the shareholders’ meeting for approval. However, the Board of Directors has the authority to approve interim dividend payments, upon determining that the Company has sufficient profits to do so without posing any impact on its business operations. Said approval shall be reported at the subsequent shareholders’ meeting.
